**Goal of the Day:** Get the code working, hopefully. And make progress on the equations for Boltzmann's constant.

**Code:** We had an error code in the first line, "could not find Module CV". We had in use pip to install opencv in python using the anaconda prompt to fix this. 
Having a problem with where the video is saved and it won't read the file correctly. We fixed this issue by copying the path to the file, because the video was saved to my onedrive, so it couldn't open without the whole path.
We got the code to work and give us a vector field:

Note: This isn't the whole vector field. 

The next step is to go through the vector validation part of the code and make sure that the data is meaningful to us.

**Summary:** We went through code and finally got it to work. We got some results in the form of a velocity vector field. It is not necessarily meaningful data. We need to do some corrections on the velocities and shorten the video so it tracks the particles better.
