**Goal of the Day:** Try to fix our problem with the smoke collection, or get some results somehow.

**Smoke Chamber:** We have decided to not use the smoke chamber that we have for the experiment. Instead, we are going to use the smoke jar. We will ignite the magnesium, and then swap out the lid of the jar, removing all the wiring in the process. Then we are going to place the jar itself under the microscope.

**Smoke Jar:** We have run into another problem with the ignition of the magnesium strip. Today, we tried to ignite a strip and it simply did not work. We used the same method that we used in the past, but it was not working for some reason we don't know. Instead, we might just get a candle lighter and use that to ignite it. 

**Summary:** Not much accomplished today, we set up a curtain and moved our experimental setup to a dark corner, but we could not even successfully ignite some magnesium today. We decided to not use the smoke chamber and instead use the jar that we make the smoke in.
