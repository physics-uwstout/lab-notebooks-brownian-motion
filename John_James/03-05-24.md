**Goal of the Day:** Try our new microscope to observe Brownian motion

**Results:** We tried 2 new microscopes. We found out that the microscope cannot be underlit for it work. Neither of the microscopes we used were able to get results. We believe that the problem resides in the focal length of the microscopes we are using. 

**Going Forward:** We are not able to make progress on our experiment currently, due to our microscope situation. There are a couple of things we can do going forward:
- Research what microscopes are ideal to work with Brownian motion and air particles
- We could dive into coding and see what results we can get from that

**Summary:** We did not have success from the new microscopes that we used. The microscope cannot be underlit. We might try some new methods going forward.
