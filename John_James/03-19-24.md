**Goal of the Day:** Try to observe some Brownian Motion with the new adjustments we made.

**Adjustments:** We tried to find the focus point of the microscope and line it up with where the light was hitting the jar. We also pointed the light at the top of the jar so there were as few smoke particles in the way as possible. Finally, we used a new mason jar that was much clearer.

**Results:** We finally got the a good view of the Brownian motion with the new setup. We think that this was a combination of the adjustments that we made, but primarily changing to a new mason jar was the most important adjustment. Having the microscope focus on light beneath a dirty mason jar was just not possible, but with a clear one it worked great.

**Going Forward:** Our next step is to use the built in camera on the microscope to record what motion we are seeing in the smoke chamber. Then we will use a software to track this motion, and hopefully calculate some values from it. 

**Summary:** Today is the most successful day we have had in a while. After some new adjustments we got some results from the microscope and could see the individual particles and how they were moving. Next, we will get the camera on the microscope to track the particles.
