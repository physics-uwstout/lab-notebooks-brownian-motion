Day 1 - 2-6-24
- Researched Brownian motion and read through PDFs
- Got a first look at the experiment and what it entails

Day 2 - 2-8-24
- Collected materials
- Watched Brownian motion video and saw examples of experiment
- Figured out initial details and what we would need for the structure of the experiment
- Got a rough understanding of what our goals with the experiment would be:
	- Initial:
		- build the apparatus
		- perform the experiment
		- see smoke particles
	- Secondary:
		- add electrically charged aspects to the experiment
		- measure how varying electric fields affect the atoms and smoke

Day 3 - 2-13-24
- Measured out the dimensions of our box to hold the smoke and prepared to cut it into the right size next class. 
	- 6cm x 6cm for sides
	- 6cm x 7cm for top and bottom
- created a test chamber for lighting the fire. We took a jar and cut 2 holes in the top to pass wires through. then hooked up one end of the wires to a DC power supply and the other end to a nichrome wire wrapped around a piece of magnesium. The values were roughly 4V and 3.5A. After a few seconds, the magnesium ignited and filled smoke into the jar.
	- our biggest struggle here was finding a way to successfully pull the smoke from the jar and be able to transfer it. We tried a few different things and one of them had us able to successfully pull smoke shortly after the fire, but after waiting a few seconds it becomes much more difficult to pull smoke even though it can still easily be seen in the jar.

Day 4 - 2-15-24
- Today we were kind of halted with our experiment as we needed to get the box created to transfer smoke into it and be able to point the laser at it to see the particles. We were able to do a test with the jar and make sure the laser will work and we will be able to see a line of particles across our diffused beam. My initial impressions seem like it will work. Now we just needed to get our vinyl cut into pieces so that we can assemble them together. At the time of writing, Dr. Zimmerman is checking whether the band saw, or milling will be the best approach to take with those pieces. 
- I worked a bit on collecting photos of the experiment for both future reference as well as for my class presentation. Here are the photo collected today:

- These show the laser illuminating the smoke particles in our jar so that we are able to see them:

Day 5 - 2-20-24
We spent most of today creating the box that we will be transferring the smoke into to monitor it with our laser and microscope. we took all of our box pieces that got cut last time and stuck them all together with epoxy. A lot of the day was spent waiting around for the epoxy to dry. Once we got the box held together we went back and filled any gaps with more epoxy to ensure that no smoke could leak out. We also drilled a hole in one side so that the syringe we are using to transfer the smoke can fit through and allow us to put smoke into the box.

Here is a picture of the hole in the box where we can transfer the smoke into it:

Lastly, we began figuring out how we are going to create our stand to hold the tiny tube which acts as a sort of lens and allows us to make our laser into a line instead of a point. A line laser will allow us to see more particles than the single point laser would.

Day 6 - 2-22-24
We started off the day by testing to make sure that there were no leaks in the box by filling it with water. If no water leaks out, no smoke should either.
- we had a small leak but were able to identify it and fill it with epoxy

Next we set up everything together to see if we need to change anything around prior to starting the full experiment and begin trying to gather data.
- apart from a few minor things like making sure everything was positioned correctly, we were ready to do our first full test run
- we want to eventually build (3D print?) a base that can hold our containers and the laser so they can stay in the same place without moving around between tests.

Below is a photo of our laser going through the tool which turns the point laser into a line laser.

First test results:
- We got everything aligned well, started the fire from burning the magnesium, and then tried to pull smoke into our syringe. We tried a few different times to ensure that the syringe was completely full of smoke and after looking at it determined that our smoke wasn't concentrated enough to have one single syringe be able to transfer enough smoke that the particles can be viewed
- We tried pulling smoke and putting it into our box a few different times but the smoke just wasn't concentrated enough after the transfer process to be able to view any particles.
- The laser also was not able to light up any particles, probably partially because the lighting in the lab is so bright but also because the smoke was too unconcentrated. 

We decided we would need to rework some of our experiment
- We need a more efficient way of starting the fire because our current method takes too much space and the smoke can not be concentrated enough
- We need a better way of lighting the smoke particles and blocking out external light
- We also need some sort of base so that we can keep everything aligned correctly and ensure that when we start collecting data stuff isn't getting moved around between our tests.

Below is a photo of our experiment setup for the first test. The jar and DC power supply used for starting the magnesium fire is not pictured.
