**Goal of the Day:** Get the digital camera to work on the microscope and use it to track the Brownian motion of the particles.

**Digital Camera:** We got the download, Amscope, for the digital camera to work. It took some messing around with: we needed a USB 3.0 cable, and the right download from the Amscope website. However, the video that the camera could record was very choppy, and worked at 4 frames per second which would not work very well for when we try to track the particles. We could see the image well enough, though. Next, we will try to use our phone cameras mounted on top of the microscope to get a clearer video to track. 

**Tracking Software:** I Downloaded a PIV guided jupyter notebook from Gervase. I started going through that and downloading the required files. Tomorrow, I will test the code with a premade video to make sure to works, then I will try on our videos of the smoke chamber.

**Summary:** We found a way to record the the smoke chamber with the Brownian motion, and are currently working on code that will track the particles and give us some meaningful data.
