**Goal of the Day:** We have the pieces of acrylic sheets to make the box, so our plan today it to make the smoke chamber and try to transfer smoke from the jar to the chamber, and if we have time, get the microscope working.

**Smoke Chamber:** We are using epoxy to put the box together. We also drilled a hole in one side of the box to put smoke into the chamber from the smoke jar using our syringe.  

**Syringe:** We got some new equipment to help the syringe, so we will mess around with that when we do our next test run.

**Light Source:** We got a wood stand for our circular lens, so it helps keep the light in a thin sheet.

**Summary**: Today, we finished our construction of the smoke chamber by epoxying the acrylic panels together, and we got some new equipment to help us transfer the smoke from the jar to the chamber. Finally, we got a stand to help keep our light source stable.
