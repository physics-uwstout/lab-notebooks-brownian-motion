**Goal of the Day:** We are planning to cut out the sheets for the box today, but that might not be possible: we need to consult Zimmerman to see if the bandsaw or mill or another device will be the best to cut it.

**Light Source:** We are going to test the light source today. We currently have only a laser pointer which can be manipulated by a circular lens to give a straight line. We are going to burn a magnesium strip and shine the laser through the jar to see if the laser interacts with the smoke. 

Conclusion: The laser interacts and lights up the smoke particles. This is the result we wanted so the next step is to build a base to hold up the circular lens. Then when we have the box built, we can set up the light projecting into the stable lens onto our box with the smoke, and observe the Brownian motion
