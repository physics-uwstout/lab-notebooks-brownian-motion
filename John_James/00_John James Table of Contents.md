	Summary: Went over the given information on the Brownian Motion and Smoke Chains. There were 3 research papers that were provided, and we started to go over them and take notes on them.

	Summary:  We chose the experimental setup we will start with. We will need a jar to ignite magnesium and extract the smoke, then put the smoke in a chamber where there is a thin film of light source coming from the side. We will observe the Brownian motion from a microscope above the chamber. We currently have the material to make the chamber, we need to cut out the panels and put it together.
