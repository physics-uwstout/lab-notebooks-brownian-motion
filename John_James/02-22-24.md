**Goal of the Day**: We have all of our equipment ready to perform our experiment to observe Brownian motion, so that will be our goal today.

**Smoke Chamber:** We tested our smoke chamber for leaks by filling it with water and rolling it around the edges. We used epoxy to fill the one crack that we have.

**Final Experimental Setup**: We have our setup completed which is as follows:
- Smoke Jar: uses DC current and a nichrome wire to ignite magnesium strip, has hole to extract smoke using the syringe
- Smoke Chamber: Acrylic panels glued together using epoxy, has one hole to inject smoke from smoke jar
- Light source: Laser through circular lens to give a thin sheet of light projected on smoke particles
- Microscope: used to see Brownian motion 

**Problems:** We are not getting enough smoke from the jar to the chamber, and cannot see the smoke particles with our light source. Some reasons for this could be:
- Our jar is too large and the MgO is being diluted with air too much
- Our syringe is not pulling out enough smoke and is taking in air with the smoke it pulls out 
- Our smoke chamber could also be too big

**Potential Solutions:**
- We could get a smaller jar so our MgO will be of larger density 
- We could try igniting more magnesium to get more smoke
- We could use a vacuum tube system to get all the smoke out of the jar and to the chamber
- Also, when we view the smoke particles, it needs to be in a dark area to see the laser's effect on the smoke particles

**Summary:** Our experimental setup was complete, but we had problems transferring smoke from the jar to the chamber. We brainstormed some ways to fix this problem.
