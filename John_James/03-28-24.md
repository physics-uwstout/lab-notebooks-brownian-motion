**Goal of the Day:** Get the code working and track the velocities of the particles. Also find the equations we need to get.

**Code:** Not much progress was made on the code, I had trouble getting the code to show up in the place that I wanted it too, but I did get that resolved by the end of the day. Next, I the code wasn't importing the cv2 that it needed, despite me downloading and updating the version through anaconda prompt.

**Equations:** My partner, Joaquin, spent the day on this and made progress, but I did not get a chance to review what he had.

**Summary:** We made progress on the equations we are solving for, but not much progress was made on the code that we needed to get working.
