	Summary: Went over the given information on the Brownian Motion and Smoke Chains. There were 3 research papers that were provided, and we started to go over them and take notes on them.

[[02-08-24]]
	Summary:  We chose the experimental setup we will start with. We will need a jar to ignite magnesium and extract the smoke, then put the smoke in a chamber where there is a thin film of light source coming from the side. We will observe the Brownian motion from a microscope above the chamber. We currently have the material to make the chamber, we need to cut out the panels and put it together.

	Summary: We got our smoke jar fully operational, and we have measured out the pieces from the acrylic sheets that we need to cut out.

	Summary: We have confirmed that the light source that we have is capable of lighting the layer of smoke particles. We also now have our parts for making the smoke chamber. However, we encountered a problem with the syringe and pulling out the smoke, so we have some work to do on that.

	Summary: Today, we finished our construction of the smoke chamber by epoxying the acrylic panels together, and we got some new equipment to help us transfer the smoke from the jar to the chamber. Finally, we got a stand to help keep our light source stable.

	Summary: Our experimental setup was complete, but we had problems transferring smoke from the jar to the chamber. We brainstormed some ways to fix this problem.
