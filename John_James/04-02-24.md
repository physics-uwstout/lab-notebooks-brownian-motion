**Goal of the Day:** Try to get the code working and find the constants and equations we need to solve for some meaningful data.

**Boltzmann's Constant:**
From pdf "Measuring Boltzmann's..."

Boltzmann's Constant:  ![[Pasted image 20240402100602.png]]

k = Boltzmann's Constant 
$\eta$ = viscosity of fluid
$\alpha$ = particle radius 
T = temperature 
D = diffusion constant 


**Summary:** We looked through the pdf of the research papers to see if there were some calculations that we can make with the knowledge we have of the system, so we can get some meaningful results from it.
