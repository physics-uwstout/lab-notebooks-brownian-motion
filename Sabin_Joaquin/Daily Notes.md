Day 1 - 2-6-24
- Researched Brownian motion and read through PDFs
- Got a first look at the experiment and what it entails

Day 2 - 2-8-24
- Collected materials
- Watched Brownian motion video and saw examples of experiment
- Figured out initial details and what we would need for the structure of the experiment
- Got a rough understanding of what our goals with the experiment would be:
	- Initial:
		- build the apparatus
		- perform the experiment
		- see smoke particles
	- Secondary:
		- add electrically charged aspects to the experiment
		- measure how varying electric fields affect the atoms and smoke

Day 3 - 2-13-24
- Measured out the dimensions of our box to hold the smoke and prepared to cut it into the right size next class. 
	- 6cm x 6cm for sides
	- 6cm x 7cm for top and bottom
- created a test chamber for lighting the fire. We took a jar and cut 2 holes in the top to pass wires through. then hooked up one end of the wires to a DC power supply and the other end to a nichrome wire wrapped around a piece of magnesium. The values were roughly 4V and 3.5A. After a few seconds, the magnesium ignited and filled smoke into the jar.
	- our biggest struggle here was finding a way to successfully pull the smoke from the jar and be able to transfer it. We tried a few different things and one of them had us able to successfully pull smoke shortly after the fire, but after waiting a few seconds it becomes much more difficult to pull smoke even though it can still easily be seen in the jar.

Day 4 - 2-15-24
- Today we were kind of halted with our experiment as we needed to get the box created to transfer smoke into it and be able to point the laser at it to see the particles. We were able to do a test with the jar and make sure the laser will work and we will be able to see a line of particles across our diffused beam. My initial impressions seem like it will work. Now we just needed to get our vinyl cut into pieces so that we can assemble them together. At the time of writing, Dr. Zimmerman is checking whether the band saw, or milling will be the best approach to take with those pieces. 
- I worked a bit on collecting photos of the experiment for both future reference as well as for my class presentation. Here are the photo collected today:

- These show the laser illuminating the smoke particles in our jar so that we are able to see them:

Day 5 - 2-20-24
We spent most of today creating the box that we will be transferring the smoke into to monitor it with our laser and microscope. we took all of our box pieces that got cut last time and stuck them all together with epoxy. A lot of the day was spent waiting around for the epoxy to dry. Once we got the box held together we went back and filled any gaps with more epoxy to ensure that no smoke could leak out. We also drilled a hole in one side so that the syringe we are using to transfer the smoke can fit through and allow us to put smoke into the box.

Here is a picture of the hole in the box where we can transfer the smoke into it:

Lastly, we began figuring out how we are going to create our stand to hold the tiny tube which acts as a sort of lens and allows us to make our laser into a line instead of a point. A line laser will allow us to see more particles than the single point laser would.

Day 6 - 2-22-24
We started off the day by testing to make sure that there were no leaks in the box by filling it with water. If no water leaks out, no smoke should either.
- we had a small leak but were able to identify it and fill it with epoxy

Next we set up everything together to see if we need to change anything around prior to starting the full experiment and begin trying to gather data.
- apart from a few minor things like making sure everything was positioned correctly, we were ready to do our first full test run
- we want to eventually build (3D print?) a base that can hold our containers and the laser so they can stay in the same place without moving around between tests.

Below is a photo of our laser going through the tool which turns the point laser into a line laser.

First test results:
- We got everything aligned well, started the fire from burning the magnesium, and then tried to pull smoke into our syringe. We tried a few different times to ensure that the syringe was completely full of smoke and after looking at it determined that our smoke wasn't concentrated enough to have one single syringe be able to transfer enough smoke that the particles can be viewed
- We tried pulling smoke and putting it into our box a few different times but the smoke just wasn't concentrated enough after the transfer process to be able to view any particles.
- The laser also was not able to light up any particles, probably partially because the lighting in the lab is so bright but also because the smoke was too unconcentrated. 

We decided we would need to rework some of our experiment
- We need a more efficient way of starting the fire because our current method takes too much space and the smoke can not be concentrated enough
- We need a better way of lighting the smoke particles and blocking out external light
- We also need some sort of base so that we can keep everything aligned correctly and ensure that when we start collecting data stuff isn't getting moved around between our tests.

Below is a photo of our experiment setup for the first test. The jar and DC power supply used for starting the magnesium fire is not pictured.

Day 7 - 2-27-24
We decided to restructure our experiment a little bit because we found a few things that are having implications:

1 - We noticed the lighting in the lab is too bright for the laser to have any effect on the smoke. We moved our setup to a corner where we were able to hang a curtain and block out most of the light. We are hoping it will make it easier to see the laser hit things now.

2 - Transferring the smoke from the jar to our box chamber is not efficient. we need to get a large amount of smoke into the box in order for the laser to be able to hit the particles and actually have it show up to the human eye and microscope, but currently using a syringe to transfer it cannot get the smoke to be transferred in large enough quantities.
We are going to test starting the fire in the jar, swapping the cap to a different one without holes, and then looking at that directly under the microscope. This should keep the smoke much more dense and have enough particles to monitor.

3 - Using nichrome wire that is holding a piece of magnesium is very slow and inefficient. Sometimes our magnesium starts on fire after a minute or two, but sometimes it doesn't even start the magnesium on fire. We are thinking since we won't need to keep the jar sealed anyway it might make the most sense to just use a lighter that has a long tip (like the ones used for candles) and then quickly seal the jar after the fire has started. (We realized we can't do this because a lighter does not get hot enough to burn magnesium)

Overall, today we unfortunately weren't able to make too much progress because of our Nichrome wire fire starting system being too finnicky. Going forward, we are going to hopefully change this and not have to deal with it anymore. We were able to identify some problems, and hopefully going forward we are able to prevent these from being an issue.

At the end of class we swapped our old power supply to a new one which can output up to 40A. We need to be a lot more careful now but it should be able to start our fire much quicker.

Update: the new power supply makes the magnesium burn extremely quickly, and solves our issue of having to wait around forever. I'd still like to create something that is more efficient from a setup/cleanup perspective, but for now this will allow us to move forward.


Day 8 - 2-29-24
Now that we have a better way of starting the magnesium on fire, we started off today by filling our jar with smoke and bringing it over to use with the laser.
As I talked about last time, we decided that it was too inefficient to light the fire in one jar, and then transfer it over to a different one so we decided to just light the fire, fill the jar with smoke, and then put a lid on the jar and bring it over directly. Doing it this way means we need to clean the jar a lot more often but it also means that we will get a lot more smoke to look at.
We ran our experiment, filled the jar with smoke, and brought it over to the microscope and pointed the laser at it. We fiddled with it a little bit and got the laser pointed at the jar to see the particles:

![[ExperimentSetupV1.5.jpeg]]

We were able to get it all situated and block out external light (which made our laser show up better) and we were able to light up the particles and see movement with our eyes. The video below is a bit blurry but shows the particles.

![[ParticleMovement.mov]]

Once we could see that we successfully got some success, we aimed our microscope at it and tried to get it to focus and view the particles. Unfortunately, we could not get our microscope to focus. We tried a few different things:
- Raised our laser to bring the lit up particles closer to the lens
- Moved the jar around
- Adjusted the lighting
- Used more and less smoke
- Reducing glare on the glass

After still having no success, we decided to change microscopes to one that is able to have different lenses which will allow us to focus in a bit better on the smoke.

We went through a bit of a process disassembling the microscope to be able to fit our jar in, but once we did we adjusted our setup a little bit so that it has the correct height on everything. It now looks like this, which I call our Experiment Setup V2:

Day 9 - 3-5-24
Today we are going to test out our new microscope and hopefully actually be able to see some moving particles up close. We started the day with a full run of the experiment.

When we got to the step of actually seeing the particles through our microscope we spent a lot of time actually trying to calibrate the microscope properly but unfortunately had no success. We think that the issue is that the new microscope was meant to be used with a backlight and show very small samples on slides. unfortunately we can't use the backlight because we need the laser to light up the particles instead. without the light shining directly into the lens, though, the image appears to be completely black and we can't see anything. We think our first microscope style was a better fit, but just did not have a lens that could zoom in enough for us to look at the particles inside the jar.

We spent our time after this doing a bit of research on what type of microscope we would need to do what we are trying, and also began looking at some ways we can use code to plot our Brownian motion data once we are able to actually get some. 


Day 10 - 3-7-24
Unfortunately today we did not make much progress. Between classes we contacted Dr. Zimmerman to see if he had a better microscope for the job as the new one we got seems to require a backlight in order for the lens to see anything but having the light on makes it impossible to see the laser. He emailed back saying we should try other lenses so we grabbed a bunch from a different lab and tried them. It seems like even with a lower zoom the issue of the backlight still seems to be present. 

We tried going back to the first microscope and raising it as high as it would go. We then tried lowering the laser to the bottom of the jar to create as much distance as possible between the particles and the lens. We tried focusing the lens on some other things just to see if we could get it to work. We were able to focus on some things like the glass detail and a sharpie when we tested it. Once we put the jar of smoke back it showed us a new problem which is that since we are viewing it from the top, if we are looking for smoke at the bottom of the jar then there will be the top and middle of the jar still filled with smoke in between the laser-lit particles and the lens. Since there is so much in between, it makes it impossible to see any detail in the laser-lit particles as it's just too blurry. 

We'll have to see how we can correct this on Tuesday, but until then we aren't really able to move forward.


Day 11 - 3-19-24
Today we finally had some success! We set up our experiment one last time, focused in the microscope, and adjusted everything as necessary. Here is a photo of our experiment setup (I call it ExperimentSetupV3):
![[ExperimentSetupV3.jpeg]]

We also used a new jar which was cleaner so that there would not be any buildup from the smoke blocking what our microscope can see. After a bit of adjustment to get everything fine-tuned we were finally able to see the particles. Here is a video of the particles that can be seen with our eyes (not using the microscope)
![[ParticlesMoving.mp4]]
As you can see, the particles are moving through the jar pretty quickly and the laser is able to light up a strip of these particles quite well. 


And here is a view of what we see when looking through the microscope:
![[MicroscopeParticlesMoving.mp4]]
You can see that the particles are completely in focus and you can actually see the movement quite well. 

I think the biggest factor in getting this to work has been properly getting the microscope focused, and using a clean jar. In the moment we did not really realize how dirty our jar was but looking at it in comparison to our clean one we can see that our previous jar was very dirty and was probably preventing the microscope from seeing past the glass and into the actual smoke. 
Our next step now is to setup the camera and get some recordings of this motion and have it sent to our laptop so we can monitor it however we need to.


Day 12 - 3-21-24
