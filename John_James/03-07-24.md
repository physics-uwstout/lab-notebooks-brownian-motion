**Goal of the Day:** Try and research some new ways to observe Brownian motion

**Results:** We are still having trouble with the microscope we have to observe the motion of the smoke particles. We have considered a few ways to improve the experiment:
- We could use a clearer smoke chamber which would help with the clarity of the microscope. We could also try to use the chamber that we built
- The problem with our microscope is the focus point, we might try to raise the microscope so that we can focus it better.

**Summary:** Again, we had no luck with improving the experiment. We are not entirely sure where to go from here, as we need to get some form of results.
