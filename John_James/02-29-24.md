**Goal of the Day:** Try to fix our smoke problem and run a test to observe Brownian Motion 

**Smoke Jar:** We got a much more powerful DC voltage source to light our magnesium. It is about 10x more powerful. This lets us use the thicker nichrome wire which helps light up the magnesium faster. 

**Results:** We ran our experiment and put our jar of smoke under the microscope. We could physically see the Brownian motion, which was very promising. However, we could not get the microscope to focus on the layer of light. We noticed a couple things in the experiment we could improve on.
- We moved the light source up so the layer of light was closer to the microscope
- We could try to put a piece of black paper under the jar and behind it, to prevent the reflections of the light from coming back and disrupting the layer of light
- We got a new microscope that has multiple lenses that we can try to get a better focus 

**Summary:** We got a new, more powerful voltage source to ignite the magnesium faster. We also ran our experiment for the first time, we could physically see the smoke particles with our eyes, but under the microscope we could not get it focused. We then brainstormed some solutions.
