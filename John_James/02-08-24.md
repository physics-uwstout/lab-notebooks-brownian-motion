**Goal of the Day:** Look through the research projects' experimental setup and determine what we are choosing to do for our experiment, and how we are going to perform the experiment: what apparatus we need, what materials we need to buy, and what we need to make.

**Current materials:** 
	-DC power supply
	-AC power supply
	-Jumper wires
	-Magnesium ribbon
	-Plastic tubing

**Experimental Plan:** We currently have the materials to best setup the experiment outlined in the third pdf: Stephan - 2023 -...
MgO is said to be a very consistent smoke particle which can be made from combusting magnesium strips in ambient air.

**Experimental Setup:** The first thing to build is a jar that ignites the magnesium strip and captures all the smoke. Then we can take the smoke and transfer it into a chamber where there are diodes and a light source in a strip that lights the smoke. A camera is mounted on top to see the single layer of particles in the smoke chamber.


**TO DO:** 
1. Build a jar that can hold the smoke and safely ignite the magnesium strip
2. Be able to ignite the strip with the power supply we have
3. Build a box that can hold the smoke under the microscope
4. Have a light source in a thin strip projected onto the box from the side.

**Smoke Chamber:** We have some acrylic sheeting from previous labs that can be repurposed to make the box. We need to make the box pretty small so that not that much smoke is required to fill it. We were thinking of making it a 3in cube. Next class we will measure out the correct length for panels and use epoxy to put it together. The only other thing we need for the box is a small hole on one side to inject smoke into the box

**Smoke Jar:** We need a jar to hold the smoke initially. We will put 3 holes in the lid of the jar, 2 for the wires which we will use to ignite the magnesium strip, and 1 for a syringe to extract the smoke.

**Summary:** We chose the experimental setup we will start with. We will need a jar to ignite magnesium and extract the smoke, then put the smoke in a chamber where there is a thin film of light source coming from the side. We will observe the Brownian motion from a microscope above the chamber. We currently have the material to make the chamber, we need to cut out the panels and put it together.
