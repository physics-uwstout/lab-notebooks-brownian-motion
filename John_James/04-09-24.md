**Goal of the Day:** We need to adjust some of the numbers in the code to get more meaningful results.

**Code:** There are some things that we had to adjust for the code listed:
	-Video: the first thing that we changed for the code was making the video shorter. I used Vimeo to crop the video to 1 second long. The frame rate for the video was 30 fps, so there will be 30 frames for the code to analyze.
	- winsize = 30
	- searchize = 38
	- overlap = 22
	- We changed the previous variables to be larger so they can track the particles better because they are moving fast
	- dt = 1/30 for the frame rate 
	- scaling_factor = .463
	- We changed the scaling factor to be less based on the size of the particle

**Results:** After the changes we were able to get some better results:
We are able to see a bit better the random direction of some of the particles

**Summary:** We made some changes to the code and got some more meaningful results
