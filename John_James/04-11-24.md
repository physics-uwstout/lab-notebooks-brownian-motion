**Goal of the Day:** Redo some experiments to fix some problems we had with the videos

**Experiment:** One thing we noticed from our results is that there is some general flow that the particles follow, which skews our results. We believe the particles are speeding up to flow away from the heat of the residual nichrome wire in the jar. We plan to fix this by putting the jar in a room temperature water bath to dissipate all the heat in the jar so that the Brownian Motion is more apparent.

**Summary:** We reran our experiment with some changes to get better results. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a good video of the results.
