**Goal of the Day:** Get a good video that we can use to track the particles, so we can use a code to find the velocities.

**Laser:** We got a new laser, which is green. Hopefully, it can illuminate the particles more clearly and find help us track them better. This laser ended up working great and the visual results from it were much better than the ones from the red laser. 

**Video Results:** We determined that the Amscope was not goin to work because it was way too slow at 4fps. We also determined that recording with our phones through the lens could not get enough definition on the particles to track them. We found a software on the Appstore that can help focus on the particles better, which resulted in the following clips:

**A Few Notes:** We believe that the particles should be good enough to run a test on them , but we will not know for certain until we can put the video in the code. Also, the motion of the particles is not really what we expected them to be. We expected a more random motion than what we observed. We currently believe that this might be due to the shape of the jar that the smoke is in, which affects the flow of the particles.

**Moving Forward:** The next step is to track the velocity of the particles using our code, and then calculate some stuff to get some meaningful data.

**Summary:** Today we were able to get a good video of the particles moving. Now we have to use code to track the particles and do some calculations.
