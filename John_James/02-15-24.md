**Goal of the Day:** We are planning to cut out the sheets for the box today, but that might not be possible: we need to consult Zimmerman to see if the bandsaw or mill or another device will be the best to cut it.

**Light Source:** We are going to test the light source today. We currently have only a laser pointer which can be manipulated by a circular lens to give a straight line. We are going to burn a magnesium strip and shine the laser through the jar to see if the laser interacts with the smoke. 

Conclusion: The laser interacts and lights up the smoke particles. This is the result we wanted so the next step is to build a base to hold up the circular lens. Then when we have the box built, we can set up the light projecting into the stable lens onto our box with the smoke, and observe the Brownian motion

**Problem:** The syringe that we have is not pulling out enough smoke for us to use in the chamber. We believe this is due to how long the attachment to the syringe is, because it has to pull out a lot of air before pulling out the smoke.

**Smoke Chamber:** We have the pieces successfully cut out of the acrylic sheets so we can work on putting it together in the future 

**Summary:** We have confirmed that the light source that we have is capable of lighting the layer of smoke particles. We also now have our parts for making the smoke chamber. However, we encountered a problem with the syringe and pulling out the smoke, so we have some work to do on that.
